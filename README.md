# CPSC-481-Gomoku-project

## Problem
For this assignment, we aim to create a competitive AI agent for playing the game of Gomoku. Gomoku is similar to Tic-Tac-Toe but is played on a 15x15 board and requires a player to connect five pieces in a row to win. The AI agent will employ a **minimax algorithm** with an **evaluation function** tailored to Gomoku, enabling it to make optimal moves and counter strategies effectively.

## Goals
- Develop a Gomoku-playing AI using Python.
- Utilize a minimax algorithm to simulate possible moves and outcomes.
- Design and optimize an evaluation function specifically for the Gomoku game to assess board states and select moves strategically.

## Prerequisites:

Windows
Install Python from python.org.
Install the windows-curses library to enable curses support:
```
pip install windows-curses
python Gomoku_my version.py
```

macOS and Linux
Python and curses support are typically pre-installed on macOS and Linux systems.
```
python3 Gomoku_my version.py
```

## How to Play
Objective: Be the first player to align five pieces in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
Controls:
Arrow Keys: Move the cursor around the board.
w Key: Place a white piece (for the white player's turn).
b Key: Place a black piece (for the black player's turn).
q Key: Quit the game.
